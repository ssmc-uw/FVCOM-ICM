!pCO2 or fCO2 in the atmosphere (microatm or ppmv).  First line: option for air-sea exchange parameterization
! Second line: UNIFORM or SPATIAL. Third line: fCO2 or pCO2. If pCO2 provided instead of fCO2, a fugacity factor will be used to turn pCO2 into fCO2 in the code.
! Fourth+ line(s): If UNIFORM, fourth line has pCO2air value. If SPATIAL, each line has pCO2air per node.

%  KSO4: Integer that indicates the KSO4 dissociation constants that are to be used,      
%         in combination with the formulation of the borate-to-salinity ratio to be used.
%         Having both these choices in a single argument is somewhat awkward, 
%         but it maintains syntax compatibility with the previous version.
%  1 = KSO4 of Dickson & TB of Uppstrom 1979  (PREFERRED) 
%  2 = KSO4 of Khoo    & TB of Uppstrom 1979
%  3 = KSO4 of Dickson & TB of Lee 2010
%  4 = KSO4 of Khoo    & TB of Lee 2010
